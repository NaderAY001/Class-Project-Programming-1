/*      MODIFICATIONS
 Feb 4 2024 - Completed header asking for name and
 outputing the first name back
 Feb 18 2024 - Gave user options to decide on square root,
 power of a number, finding out letter grade based on GPA, or exit
 Mar 3 2024 - Modified the welcome section to be more clean and
 efficent. Put the options and swicth in a loop until the user
 wants to exit. Added exit case and default to the switch. Added
 another option to make a triangle. Added box around options
 Mar 17 2024 - Modified swicth statement and commented on case
 4 and 0. Made cases 3 and 4 into user defined functions. made 2 more
 user defined functions. One for calculating weekly pay and one for
 showing yearly interest. I added them in the menu and fixed the box
 Apirl 7 2024 - I changed the global variables rate and hours to local
 and set then to 0.0. Made the orignal header into a user defined function.
 Made a user defined function for the user entering their first and last
 name then welcomes them.
 Apirl 21 2024 - I added a function to ask the user for 5 grades,
 display them and displays the average
 May 5 2024 - I added a structure for contacts and an user defined function 
 to display the prepopulated array of contacts
